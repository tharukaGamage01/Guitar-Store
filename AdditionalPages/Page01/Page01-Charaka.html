		<h2>Stringed Instruments in History</h2>
		<p>The guitar has been around since the beginning of time, likely originating from the Greek word "Î" (kithara). Hermes is credited with making the first one out of a tortoise shell.</p>

		<h2>History of the Shape of Guitars</h2>
		<p>Lamech was inspired to design the oud after hanging his dead son from a tree, and the Moors brought it to Spain in 711 AD.</p>

		<h2>The First Electric Guitar Was Invented In 1937</h2>
		<p>Up until the early 20th century the acoustic guitar was all that musicians had to play with. However, it was generally felt that these instruments were simply too quiet to be heard in many situations.
			So, in the early 1930s inventor, G.D. Beauchamp and electrical engineer Adolph Rickenbacker teamed up to develop the world’s very first electric guitar – named the Rickenbacker Frying Pan.</p>

		<h2>The Earliest Known Guitar Is From Ancient Egypt</h2>
		<p>So, the word came from Persia, but where did the instrument originate? Historians believe that the oldest recorded guitar-like musical instruments came from Ancient Egypt around 1450 BC.
			This 3-stringed ancestor of the guitar was uncovered in the Valley of Kings inside the tomb of Queen Hatshepsut. It was buried next to a performer named Har-Mose who is believed to have entertained the royal court with the instrument.</p>

	<div class="section-content analysis">
		<h2>The Word Guitar Has Ancient Greek Origins</h2>
		<p>Let’s start things off with a little history lesson, shall we? Where did the word actually come from?
			The English word ‘guitar‘ was adopted from the Spanish ‘guitarra‘ during the 17th century. In turn, ‘guitarra’ is thought to have been altered from the Ancient Greek ‘kithara‘. Kithara appears four times in the Bible and is generally translated into English as ‘harp’.
			However, some experts believe that the origins of the word ‘kithara’ could date as far back as the Persian Empire from the word ‘Sihtar‘. So, a pretty darned old word, then!</p>
