      <h1>Modern Guitar's Forefather</h1>
      <img src="torres.jpg" alt="Antonio De Torres" />
        <p>
            Antonio de Torres Jurado, a 19th-century Spanish luthier, is widely regarded as the father of the modern guitar. 
            Torres revolutionized guitar design, creating the modern classical guitar shape and size we know today. His innovations included a larger body, wider waist, and thinner top, which improved the instrument's tone and volume. 
            Torres also experimented with different woods, giving the guitar new tonal possibilities. 
            His designs had such an impact that they became the standard for classical guitars, and many guitar makers still follow his principles today. 
            Torres had a profound and lasting impact on the guitar, and his legacy is still felt in the music world today.

      <h2>Early life and career:</h2>
      <p>
        Torres was born in the Spanish town of Almera on June 13, 1817.
        He started out as a carpenter but eventually became interested in guitar making.
        Torres learned the craft of making guitars from several masters, including Francisco Sánchez and José Pernas.
        In the 1850s, he established his own workshop in Almera, where he experimented with new guitar designs.

      <h2>Innovations in guitar design:</h2>
      <p>
        Torres is credited with designing the modern classical guitar, which has since become the industry standard.
        He redesigned the guitar's bracing and increased the size of the body.
        These modifications improved the guitar's volume and projection while also improving its playability.

      <h2>Influence on guitar makers and players:</h2>
      <p>
        Torres' guitars were sought after by musicians of the time, including Francisco Tárrega, who is widely regarded as the father of modern classical guitar technique.
        Many guitar makers followed Torres' designs, including Hermann Hauser and Manuel Ramirez.
        Torres' influence can still be seen in modern guitar making, with many luthiers building guitars in the traditional Spanish style.
      </p>

      <h2>Legacy and honors:</h2>
      <p>
        Torres died on November 19, 1892, but his influence in the guitar world lives on.
        In his honor, the Antonio de Torres Guitar Making Competition was founded in 1960, and it is still one of the world's most prestigious guitar making competitions.
        Many of Torres' original guitars survive and are highly valued by collectors and musicians alike.
